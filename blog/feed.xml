There has some core reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it is a fashion now, a lot of friends would write their expert essays or some mood article in Wechat Offical Account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good way to practice English-Writing skill, it is a basic skill in English using as important as English speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge output, I learned a lot in the past but had few opportunities put it out, like a machine which just absorbs but not convert to output, and it is also a good function to reinforce my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the future, I will write down the letter day to day, it may have expert technology articles and some essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hope I can insist on it and keep going!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jeremy Chen</name></author><category term="Mood" /><category term="Blog" /><summary type="html">After a long time of thinking, I decided to write something down to my new blog web.
